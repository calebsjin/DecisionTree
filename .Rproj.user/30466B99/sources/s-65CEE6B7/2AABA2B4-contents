# Foreword {-#Foreword}

I am [Caleb Jin](https://www.sjin.name/). This is my note of **decision tree**. When I try to grasp a statistical method, I'd like to wirte down every details about it that I am able to. I mainly use **An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R** [@James2014] and **The Elements of Statistical Learning** [@hastie2008]. Due to my limited statistics knowledge, if making any mistakes, I sincerely expect you guys can email to me. My email address is jinsq@ksu.edu. Appreicate!

# The Basic of Decision Tree {#basic}

Consider a continuous response variable $\uy=(y_1,y_2, \ldots, y_n)$ and $p$ many predictors $\uX = (\ux_1,\ux_2,\ldots,\ux_p)\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$.
